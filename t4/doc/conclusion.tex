\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The results obtained theoretically and by the simulation analysis were slightly different. This deviation is caused by different transistor models used in the Ngspice and in the theoretical analysis. The Ngspice model is much more complex and needs and considers a lot more parameters.\par
Nevertheless, the theoretical model presented some satisfyingly accurate results for its much lower complexity.\par
The values obtained for the Merit were 1345.8247 and 717.4149, respectively for the Ngsice's simulation and the Octave's theoretical analysis. This may seem like a great discrepancy, but is in fact fully explained by the discrepancies regarding the lower cutoff frequency (and therefore the bandwith as well) and the gain.
