\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment our focus was to study two Methods (Nodal Method and Meshes Method) in order to compare the results calculated by these methods (theoretical results) to the given ones by our circuit simulator (simulator results). By comparing them we can see that these methods are, in this case, well aplied in result of a situation that puts the possibility to calculate our variables using equations that use these two principles.
In sum,the use of these methods is a theoretical way of having precise results to unknown variables, but this is only possible because of the simplicity of this circuit. In a more complex circuit using these methods may not be as practical.
