\subsection{Analysis for $t<0$} 
For $t<0$ no current passes through the capacitor, and therefore this component behaves like an open circuit, so in this subsection we start by applying the nodal method to the circuit in order to determine the voltage in all nodes and the current on all branches. The nodal method aplies KVL. In below all equations related to nodal method are presented: 

\begin {equation}
	V_0 = 0
	\label{eq:n1}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	V_4 = V_7
	\label{eq:n2}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	V_5 - V_8 = K_d \frac{V_0 - V_4}{R_6}
	\label{eq:n3}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	V_1 - V_0 = V_s
	\label{eq:n4}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_2-V_1}{R_1} + \frac{V_2 - V_5}{R_3} + \frac{V_2 - V_3}{R_2} = 0
	\label{eq:n5}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_3-V_2}{R_2} - K_b(V_2-V_5)  = 0
	\label{eq:n6}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_5-V_2}{R_3} + \frac{V_5-V_0}{R_4} + \frac{V_5-V_6}{R_5} + \frac{V_8-V_7}{R_7}= 0
	\label{eq:n7}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	K_b(V_2-V_5) + \frac{V_6-V_5}{R_5}   = 0
	\label{eq:n8}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_4-V_0}{R_6} + \frac{V_7 - V_8}{R_7} = 0
	\label{eq:n9}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Equivalent resistor as seen from the capacitor terminals}
By replacing the independent source $V_c$ with a short circuit ($V_s=0$) we can switch off this source which will live us to calculate the equivalent resistance in C. We also needed to replace the capacitor with a voltage source $V_x=V_6-V_8$ due to the presence of dependent sources. We use the $V_6$ and $V_8$ from the previous section beacause the voltage drop at the terminals of the capacitor needs to be a continuous function (there can not be an energy discontinuity in the capacitor).A nodal analysis is performed in order to determine the current $I_x$ that is supplied by $V_x$, having in mind the previous allegation. At these point, with the results obtained before, we can determine $R_{eq}$ ($R_{eq}=V_x/I_x$). All these procedures were required in order to determine the time constant $\tau$ ($\tau=R_{eq}*C$). The time constant is crucial to determine the natural and forced solutions for $V_6$, which will be done in the next subsections. The equations considered for these calculations were \ref{eq:n1}, \ref{eq:n2}, \ref{eq:n3}, \ref{eq:n4}, \ref{eq:n5}, \ref{eq:n6} and the following:

\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_1-V_2}{R_1} + \frac{V_0-V_4}{R_6} + \frac{V_0-V_5}{R_4} = 0
	\label{eq:eq7}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	K_b(V_2-V_5) + \frac{V_6-V_5}{R_5} + I_x  = 0
	\label{eq:eq8}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{V_4-V_0}{R_6} + \frac{V_7 - V_8}{R_7} = 0
	\label{eq:eq9}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	V_x = V_6 - V_8
	\label{eq:eq10}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Natural solution for $V_6$}
Now we have to obtain the natural solution for $V_6$. We do that by remembering that the natural solution depends on the initial charge (voltage), on $R_{eq}$ and C and it is computed by removing all independent sources and applying KVL. In Octave, to compute the Natural solution the general formula derived in the theoretical classes was used: $V_{6n}(t)=Ae^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}$. \par
To resolve this formula we achieved the value of $\tau$ in the previous section and  A is a constant that can be determined through the boundary conditions (when $t=0$, $A=V_x$).

\subsection{Forced solution for $V_6$ with $f=1000Hz$}

In this section we  determine the forced solution $V_{6f}$ for the same period of time and for a level of frequency of 1KHz by using impedances instead of resistances and capacitances and by using a nodal analysis. It was also  considered that the magnitude of the phasor representing the voltage sorce $\tilde{V}_s$ was 1 ($V_s=1$), a result of expression \ref{eq:i1}. By doing all of these we achieve these equations that allow us to obtain phasor voltages in all nodes:

\begin {equation}
	Z = \frac{1}{w C j}
	\label{eq:Z}
\end{equation}

\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_s = -j
	\label{eq:vs}
\end{equation}

\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_0 = 0
	\label{eq:p1}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_4 = \tilde{V}_7
	\label{eq:p2}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_5 - \tilde{V}_8 = K_d \frac{\tilde{V}_0 - \tilde{V}_4}{R_6}
	\label{eq:p3}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_1 - \tilde{V}_0 = \tilde{V}_s
	\label{eq:p4}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{\tilde{V}_2-\tilde{V}_1}{R_1} + \frac{\tilde{V}_2 - \tilde{V}_5}{R_3} + \frac{\tilde{V}_2 - \tilde{V}_3}{R_2} = 0
	\label{eq:p5}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{\tilde{V}_3-\tilde{V}_2}{R_2} - K_b(\tilde{V}_2-\tilde{V}_5)  = 0
	\label{eq:p6}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{\tilde{V}_1-\tilde{V}_2}{R_1} + \frac{\tilde{V}_0-\tilde{V}_4}{R_6} + \frac{\tilde{V}_0-\tilde{V}_5}{R_4} = 0
	\label{eq:p7}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	K_b(\tilde{V}_2-\tilde{V}_5) + \frac{\tilde{V}_6-\tilde{V}_5}{R_5} + \frac{\tilde{V}_6-\tilde{V}_8}{Z}  = 0
	\label{eq:p8}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\frac{\tilde{V}_4-\tilde{V}_0}{R_6} + \frac{\tilde{V}_7 - \tilde{V}_8}{R_7} = 0
	\label{eq:p9}
\end{equation}
\begin {equation}
	\tilde{V}_x = \tilde{V}_6 - \tilde{V}_8
	\label{eq:p10}

\subsection{Final total solution $v_6(t)$}
In this section the final total solution $V_6$ for a frequency of 1KHz is determined by superimposing the natural and forced solutions determined in previous sections ($V_6$=$V_{n6}$+$V_{6f}$) In \textbf{Figure: ~\ref{fig:theo5}} the voltage of the independent source $V_{s}$ and the voltage of $V_{6}$ were plotted for the time interval of [-5,20] ms.

\subsection{Frequency responses $v_c(f)$, $v_s(f)$ and $v_6(f)$ for frequency range 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz}
\label{ref}
For this section, we considered $v_s( t)  = sin( 2 \pi f t )$. As we can see, the magnitude and the phase do not depend on the frequency $f$. Therefore, we are to expect these values to remain constant for both these variables in the figures \ref{fig:freq_resp} and \ref{fig:angle_resp}.\par 
This circuit can serve the purpouse of a low-pass filter, that is, when the frequencies are low, the capacitor can reach the same drop down as the input in a long period of time, which means
it will act aproximately as an open circuit, thus allowing a considerable potential drop 
from nodes 6 to 8.This means that for low frequencies the voltage in the capacitor
is in phase with the voltage source. \par
But in the other case, when we have high level of frequencies,
the capacitor only has a small time to charge up before the input changes direction, which will result in the capacitor acting like a short-circuit. Therefore, there will be close to none 
potential drop between nodes 6 and 8 and the capacitor and source will start to fall 
out of phase, for frequencies greater that the cutoff frequecy ($f_c$). 
The following formula. $f_c = \frac{1}{2.\pi.\tau}$ allow us to calculate the frequency.  
For the values provided this cutoff frequency is around 50Hz. This explains the steep drop 
in potential difference that we can see in the graph around the first and second decades.
The phase difference between the capacitor voltage and the voltage source also begins to 
show at around this frequency as can be seen in \textbf{Figure: ~\ref{fig:angle_resp}}.\par
In order to understand the phase and magnitude declination with the increase in frequency we simplefly the circuit to a voltage source, capacitor and equivalent resistor, which will live to the following equations:

\begin{equation}
  V_c = \frac{V_s}{\sqrt{1 + (R_{eq}.C.2\pi.f)^2}}
  \label{eq:freqresp1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \phi_{V_c} = -\frac{\pi}{2} + arctan(R_{eq}.C.2\pi.f)
  \label{eq:freqresp2}
\end{equation}
